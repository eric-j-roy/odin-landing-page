# odin-landing-page
Replicating a landing page with CSS through the Odin Project!

This landing page will be made up of four main sections plus a footer section. The fonts and overall image are preselected by The Odin Project, however the color scheme will be custom. This project will be a practice in basic CSS with a heavy focus on working with flexbox.
